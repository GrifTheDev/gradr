# SvelteKit Auth Example
Originally a project called gradr, this repository contains a simple example of auth with SvelteKit. This is a from scratch implementation with firestore. It is missing some key components, like email verification and login/register options with third-party services and should not be used in production. Still, I'm proud of being able to get this far until I had to abandon the project and want to share it with the world.

For reasons mentioned above, I will not be providing the steps to get the code up and running, this is purely for educational purposes.

If you have time and the know-how I ask you to try and find security vulnerabilities. This is not because I believe this code is perfect, far from it, I just want to learn so that I can make more secure auth in the future. So please reach out to me at [griffythehuman@gmail.com](mailto:griffythehuman@gmail.com) if you find anything.
